- Added some basic IRP handling, still need to add a few more touches.
- I will probably continue doing the WFP code after confirming that I can communicate with the driver through user mode.
- Exciting Stuff !!

- Been reading alot of NDIS and WFP, I accidently started using the user mode methods instead of the kernel methods for WFP :sigh:
- It was hell setting up my VM to test the kernel driver

- Okkkk, procrastinating from Minecraft Server to do this epic thing of creating VPN and later on a Nginx like application for the Minecraft Server
- Barely worked with Kernel drivers but we will make it work somehow.
